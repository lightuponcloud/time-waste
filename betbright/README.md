BetBright Technical Assignment
==============================

To implement 3 scripts:

* anagram.py:
"""
Find the anagram

Write a function that accepts a word (string) and a list of words (list or tuple of strings) and return
back a list with the valid anagrams for the word inside the given words list.
"""
Verdict: "Solution is wrong"
No more details were provided.
It just uses itertools.permutations

* cache_demo.py: LRU Cache
Result: "He didn't move the last accessed item to the most recent position, resulting in a simple caching instead of a lru_cache."

It uses ``OrderedDict``, which adds you know, order to the dict.

* date_cal.py
I did not deserve comment on that one.
