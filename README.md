Most time wasting technical assignments ever in one repo

This repository contains test assignments I have wasted my time on.

* [The game server using microservice architecture](digit) for Digit Game Studios.
It took 9 hours to complete, but technical verdict was:
"Lack of knowledge on transactions/atomicity".

* [The REST API endpoints for creating/serving recipes](dropkitchen) for getdrop.com
The application is working, but they have found "someone better", lol.

* [Publisher/Subscriber service on Erlang](celtra) for Celtra
It uses Cowboy web frwmework with mnesia db in order to receive and server messages using websockets.
A different skill set needed.

* [Log parser](./tree/master/radarservices) for RadarServices.com
Their response: "our requirements are very high". This is funny, as the script is just a log parser.

* [To implement the UK post code validation library](.scurri) for scurri.com
The task was to implement a production-ready library for UK post code validation.
Of course a reasonable programmer would use one of many existing libraries.
