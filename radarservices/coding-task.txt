Programming Task
================

Write a program in Python which processes syslog messages from a file and
outputs some statistics about them.

Please also include a text file with a short description of your approach to
the problem.


File Format
-----------

There's exactly one syslog message on each line. The messages are in the "old"
(BSD) syslog format (that is, consisting of PRI, HEADER and MSG) as defined by
the standard.

You can assume that every message adheres to the standard and all the messages
come from the same year.

The input file may be very large (dozens of gigabytes). Use Python's
multiprocessing library to process it in a reasonable time frame.


Output
------

After the whole file has been processed, output the following statistics in a
human-readable way, *per host as well as globally over all messages*:

    - the average length of the MSG part of the messages
    - the total number of Emergency and Alert severity level messages
    - the timestamp of the oldest and newest message


Example Input
-------------

The following is an example of valid input for the program (as a file):

<47>Sep 22 15:38:21 mymachine myproc% fatal error, terminating!
<34>Jan 25 05:06:34 10.1.2.3 su: 'su root' failed for sprinkles on /dev/pts/8
